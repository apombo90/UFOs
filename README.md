## Project Overview
Using JavaScript and HTML, build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Finally, customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.

Using JavaScript, create a function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage has to update with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".

## Resources
- Data source: data.js
- Software: JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap.

## Results
#### How to use the search criteria:

- The code is programed to detect any changes in the search boxes, save those inputs and filter the data. Initially, once the client opens the webpage, the table will load with all the nonfiltered data.

- The client can filter the data using only one criteria e.g. typing *"triangle"* in the *"Enter a Shape"* box and pressing *"Enter"*.

- The client can also filter by multiple criterias e.g. typing *"circle"* in the *"Enter a Shape"* box, *"ca"* for State, *"el cajon"* for City and pressing *"Enter"*.

#### How to remove the filter:

- To remove a filter, the client has to delete the input on the filter that he wants to remove and press *"Enter"*. E.g. Following the previous example, here I deleted the *"el cajon"* filter that was in the City criteria.
